# Pystander

Get it? Bystander but python. Pystander is a small and simple python script to observer a directory and move all content to another directory

# Quick start

To run the script simple run it with two parameters, the source directory and the target directory. The source directory is a path to the folder that you want to observer and the target directory is a path to the folder that you want to move the content to.

```
python app.py <PATH_TO_SOURCE_DIRECTORY> <PATH_TO_TARGET_DIRECTORY>
```

That's it, Pystander is now observing the source folder and moving all files that get added to it.
